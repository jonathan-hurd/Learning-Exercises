/*
given text and an array of words, filter the array of words down to only those
words that appear in the given text. 

Do we count the occurences of each word? Or just that there is a word in there?
  Each of the occurences is added to the new array so not just a fileter.

Given a text and an array of words
Return a new array with all the occurences of the given array's words that
appear in the text.

We could approach this as iterating over each word of the text and then checking
the array, or we could iterate over each word in the array and check the text.

String.matchAll will return an iterator object with all the matches found in
the string
